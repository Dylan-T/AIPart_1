"""Load images"""


"""Construct a set of random features"""


"""Construct a perceptron that uses the features as inputs"""


"""Train the perceptron on the images until either it has presented the whole set of images at least 100 times
or the perceptron weights have converged (ie, the perceptron is correct on all the images)"""


"""Report the number of training cycles to converge
or the number of images still classified incorrectly"""


"""Print out the features and final set of weights"""
